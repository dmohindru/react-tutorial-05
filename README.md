# Note
This project contains three branches
1. phase1: This branch contains techinques learnt while building apps 01-jsx, 02-pdas, 03-animals, 04-pics. However this techinques will lead to messy code. This phase uses Local, non-persisted list of books.
2. phase2: This branch contains a refactor from phase1 branch where we store books data on an outside API
3. phase3: This branch is extention to phase 2 with centralized state.
